make frequency cuts on the matchedfilter by cutting the template bank by cutting the tb.bank ? or frange? or an if statement before its calculated?

make segment list from like 2 days worth before data
sort list into ones with lengths longer than 128
select those gps start times from a list and hopefully there's 30 we can do
then condor q those 30 times over all frequencies, which will output data sets and
